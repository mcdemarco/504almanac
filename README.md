# 504 Almanac #

The 504 Almanac is an experiment in navigating publicly-available information about the worlds of the board game 504, most of which is on websites where the navigation is difficult or obscure.  This portal-like page provides a big, easy-to-use, mobile-friendly navigation UI as well as simple URL navigation.

## Demo

A demo is available at http://mcdemarco.net/tools/504/almanac/

To navigate directly to a world, e.g., 456, use:  http://mcdemarco.net/tools/504/almanac/#456
